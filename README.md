# Profitable Apps Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze data from both the Apple Store and Google Play to provide insights into app profiles that are likely to attract more users and be profitable for a company that builds free mobile applications.

### Project Goal
The primary objective is to assist developers in understanding the types of applications that have the potential to gain more users and generate revenue through in-app advertisements.

## Opening and Exploring the Data
The analysis begins with exploring and understanding the datasets from the Apple Store and Google Play. Various parameters such as the number of rows and columns are examined, and columns relevant to the analysis, such as app name, genre, and number of reviews/installs, are identified.

## Data Cleaning

### Deleting Incorrect Data
Incorrect or irrelevant data, such as missing values or duplicate entries, is identified and removed to ensure data accuracy.

### Removing Duplicate Data
Duplicate entries within the datasets are identified and eliminated to prevent skewing the analysis results.

### Removing Non-English Apps
Apps with non-English names are filtered out to focus on English-speaking audiences, which is essential for the company's target market.

### Isolating Free Apps
Since the company primarily develops free apps, the datasets are filtered to include only free applications for analysis.

## Data Analysis
### Most Common Apps by Genre
The analysis explores the most common app genres by examining frequency tables for both the Apple Store and Google Play datasets. This helps identify trends and preferences among users.

### Most Popular Apps by Genre
The popularity of app genres is further analyzed by calculating the average number of installs/reviews. This information aids in understanding which genres have the most active user base.

### Recommendation for App Profile
Based on the analysis results, recommendations are provided for app profiles that have the potential to be profitable on both the Apple Store and Google Play. For example, developing an app based on a popular book with added features like daily quotes, audio versions, quizzes, etc., is suggested as a viable option.

## Conclusion
The project concludes by summarizing the key findings and recommendations. It highlights the importance of data-driven decisions in app development and emphasizes the potential for success by catering to user preferences and market demand.
